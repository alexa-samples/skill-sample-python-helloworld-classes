# Build An Alexa Hello World Skill
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/quiz-game/header._TTH_.png" />

This skill gets you started with skill building by providing basic "Hello World" functionality that allows you to rapidly generate a voice response from Alexa.

## Customize the Skill to be Yours

At this point, you should have a working copy of our Hello World skill.
You may modify the code in `hello_world.py`.
For example, locate the line with the response: "Welcome to the Alexa Skills Kit, you can say hello".
Change this to a custom message, and save your code.  Then, test your skill again and you should hear a new response.

Normally, you would consider submitting your skill for certification.  But, a default "hello world" skill is too simple to provide a valuable end user experience.
Consider starting another skill project, using one of the several other templates we've in the store for you.
