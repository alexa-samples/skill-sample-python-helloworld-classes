# Build An Alexa Hello World Skill
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/quiz-game/header._TTH_.png" />

This skill gets you started with skill building by providing basic "Hello World" functionality that allows you to rapidly generate a voice response from Alexa.

## Customize the Skill to be Yours

At this point, you should have a working copy of our Hello World skill.
You may modify the code in `hello_world.py`.
For example, locate the line with the response: "Welcome to the Alexa Skills Kit, you can say hello".
Change this to a custom message, and save your code.  Then, test your skill again and you should hear a new response.

Normally, you would consider submitting your skill for certification.  But, a default "hello world" skill is too simple to provide a valuable end user experience.
Consider starting another skill project, using one of the samples here.


* [Fact Skill](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact) - the Fact skill is a simple example a great next step after Hello World.  The skill speaks facts to the user.
* [How To Skill](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto) - a skill where the user can ask for a given recipe or other response based on a look up value - a dictionary of sorts.  The sample provides Minecraft recipes, but you can customize it to provide whatever information you'd like.
* [Trivia Quiz Game](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia) - this skill asks the user a series of questions, tracks right and wrong answers and provides a score at the end of the game.
* [Fact w/In Skill Purchasing](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact-in-skill-purchases) - takes the Fact skill and adds in skill purchasing to it.
